  **Design Movement**: Modern Baltic Gov-Tech
  **Core Principles**: Transparency, Clarity, Authority, Accessibility
  **Color Philosophy**: Inspired by the Lithuanian flag (Yellow, Green, Red) but modernized. Deep forest green for authority, vibrant amber for highlights, and a clean slate/white background for readability. The goal is to evoke trust and national pride without being kitschy.
  **Layout Paradigm**: Card-based dashboard layout with a strong vertical rhythm. Use a sidebar for navigation (even if mocked) to suggest a larger app ecosystem. Content should be centered in a readable column on the main profile view.
  **Signature Elements**:
    - "Glassmorphism" cards for statistics to suggest transparency.
    - Subtle geometric patterns derived from Lithuanian folk art (sodai) in the background.
    - Crisp, high-contrast data visualizations.
  **Interaction Philosophy**: "Data at your fingertips." Hover states on charts should reveal detailed tooltips. Smooth transitions between tabs. The accountability gauge should animate on load.
  **Animation**: Gentle fade-ins for page content. The accountability score gauge should fill up with a smooth easing function. Progress bars should grow from left to right.
  **Typography System**:
    - Headings: **Inter** (or similar clean sans-serif) - Bold, authoritative.
    - Body: **Inter** - Highly readable at small sizes.
    - Data/Numbers: **JetBrains Mono** or similar monospaced font for tabular data to emphasize precision.

  **Design Movement**: Neo-Brutalism / Data-First
  **Core Principles**: Raw Data, High Contrast, Unapologetic, Functional
  **Color Philosophy**: Stark black and white with neon green and alert red accents. This style emphasizes the "hard truths" of the data. No gradients, no shadows.
  **Layout Paradigm**: Grid-based, dense information density. Borders are thick and defined.
  **Signature Elements**:
    - Hard shadows (box-shadow: 4px 4px 0px #000).
    - Monospaced typography for everything.
    - Visible grid lines.
  **Interaction Philosophy**: Instant feedback. Buttons depress physically (translate + shadow change).
  **Animation**: Snappy, linear animations. No easing.
  **Typography System**:
    - All text: **Space Grotesk** or **Courier Prime**.

  **Design Movement**: Soft UI / Neumorphism 2.0
  **Core Principles**: Comfort, Approachability, Softness, Integration
  **Color Philosophy**: Very light grays, off-whites, and soft pastels. The goal is to make political data feel less intimidating and more approachable for the average citizen.
  **Layout Paradigm**: Fluid, organic shapes. Sections blend into each other.
  **Signature Elements**:
    - Soft, inner shadows for inputs and cards.
    - Rounded corners (large border-radius).
    - Blurred backdrops.
  **Interaction Philosophy**: Gentle pushes and pulls. Buttons feel like soft rubber.
  **Animation**: Slow, spring-based animations.
  **Typography System**:
    - Headings: **Nunito** or **Quicksand** (Rounded sans).
    - Body: **Lato**.

## Selected Approach: Modern Baltic Gov-Tech

I will proceed with the **Modern Baltic Gov-Tech** approach. It strikes the best balance between professional authority (needed for a parliamentary tool) and modern usability. The "transparency" metaphor via glassmorphism aligns perfectly with the project's name ("Skaidrus" means Transparent).

**Design Philosophy**:
- **Transparency**: Use semi-transparent backgrounds and blur effects to visually represent the concept of political transparency.
- **National Identity**: Use a refined palette based on Lithuanian colors (Yellow/Green/Red) but desaturated and darkened for a professional look.
- **Data Clarity**: Prioritize the readability of the new statistics engine. The accountability score must be the visual anchor.
