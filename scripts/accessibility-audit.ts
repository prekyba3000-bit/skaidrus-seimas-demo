/**
 * Placeholder: Automated WCAG 2.1 AA audit runner
 *
 * Plan:
 * - Use Playwright/axe-core to crawl key routes (Dashboard, MP Profile, Bill Detail).
 * - Collect accessibility violations (ARIA, contrast, keyboard traps).
 * - Export JSON/HTML reports for CI artifacts.
 * - Gate CI on zero critical violations; warnings allowed but logged.
 *
 * This scaffold demonstrates intent for NGI Zero milestone delivery.
